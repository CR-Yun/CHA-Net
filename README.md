Welcome to the official repository for the CHA-Net paper: "Unsupervised Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Image Registration via Domain Adaptation".

## About the Paper
This paper presents a novel approach to the challenge of unsupervised multi-modal remote sensing image registration, leveraging the power of domain adaptation. Our methods are designed to align disparate remote sensing data, which is crucial for various applications in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and resource management.

## Code Availability
The code is currently undergoing thorough cleaning and organization to ensure it is user-friendly and well-documented. We are committed to providing the complete and clean version of the code here as soon as the paper is accepted.

**Please stay tuned! The full codebase will be released upon acceptance of our paper.**

## Submission Details
The paper has been submitted to the esteemed "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (IEEE TGRS)" journal.
